Traditionally, GeckoLib's `GeoRenderer` has a single generic type; the type of animatable it renders.

With 5.0 and the advent of `RenderState`s, this changed. Now, `GeoRenderers` have three generic types:

- `T`: The type of animatable it renders
- `O`: The type of associated data the renderer uses when extracting the render state (or `Void` if not applicable)
- `R`: The base type of `RenderState` the renderer uses

This also extends to `GeoRenderLayer`s, and so it can pay to be wary of the generic types that the base renderers use.

Because of this change, when creating a new `GeoBlockRenderer`, `GeoArmorRenderer`, or `GeoEntityRenderer` class, 
you'll need to explicitly define the `RenderState` generic type.

For example:

```java
public class MyEntityRenderer<R extends LivingEntityRenderState & GeoRenderState> extends GeoEntityRenderer<MyEntity, R> {
    // Note the generic type  ^
}
```
