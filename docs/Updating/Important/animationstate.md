title: AnimationState/AnimationTest Changes
---

In GeckoLib4, users would take an instance of `AnimationState` in their controller predicates, using it to handle the animation 
stages and `PlayState`. This caused issues with users confusing the class with the vanilla `AnimationState` class, 
and it also posed a problem when introducing the `RenderState` object.

To rectify these issues, the `AnimationController` predicate will now provide an instance of `AnimationTest`. 
It works mostly the same way, but splitting it into its own object meant I could hide away the parts that aren't 
relevant to you at the time of the predicate, eliminate some naming confusion.
